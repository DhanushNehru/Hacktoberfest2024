//Problem Statement: You are given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on an ith day.

//You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

/*Examples:-

Example 1:
Input:
 prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output:
 5
Explanation:
 Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and 
sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

Note
: That buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 
is not allowed because you must buy before 
you sell.

Example 2:
Input:
 prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output:
 0
Explanation:
 In this case, no transactions are 
done and the max profit = 0. */

## 4. Wait for Pull Request to merge

## 5. Celebrate - you've done your first pull request!!

```py
'''
Always make more than 4 pull requests.
Let's say you have made only 4 pull requests to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have the remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects are not excluded.
If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get swags or t-shirts.
I will recommend you make a pull request to your own repo which is very very safe for you.
Keep in mind that the repo has hacktoberfest topic.
